"Provable Security Theory" constitutes an advanced core course in cryptography and information security, employing formal methodologies to establish rigorous security proof frameworks for cryptographic schemes. The curriculum systematically addresses: 1) Security model formulation; 2) Reduction proof techniques; 3) Security analysis under random oracle model versus standard model paradigms; 4) Security argumentation methodologies for cryptographic protocols.
