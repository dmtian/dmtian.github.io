"Modern Cryptography" constitutes a core compulsory course in Information Security curricula, establishing a foundational framework for understanding and pursuing careers in cybersecurity-related fields. This discipline systematically equips students with comprehensive methodologies for cryptographic system design and analysis, while providing essential groundwork for advanced security research and secure system development. Course objectives include: 1) Mastery of fundamental cryptographic concepts spanning classical schemes, public-key infrastructures, digital signatures, and security protocols; 2) Comprehension of cryptographic scheme construction principles and cryptanalytic techniques; 3) Operational understanding of cryptographic implementations; 4) Development of critical thinking for practical security problem resolution. The curriculum emphasizes theoretical rigor aligned with contemporary cryptographic standards and practical engineering applications.
