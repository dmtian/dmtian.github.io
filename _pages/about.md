Miaomiao Tian, male, Master's Supervisor. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2009 and obtained a Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2014. Currently serving as an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, and Director of the Institute for Secure Computing. My primary research focuses on post-quantum cryptography and cryptographic applications in cloud computing, big data mining, encrypted traffic detection, and blockchain technologies.
I have led six research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and other programs. My academic contributions include over 40 peer-reviewed publications and more than 10 authorized invention patents. Notably, I was awarded the Second Prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by the Anhui Computer Federation for my research achievements. My work emphasizes both theoretical advancements in quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes and practical implementations of cryptographic protocols in modern computing environments.
